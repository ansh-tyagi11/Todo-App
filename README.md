# 📝 React To-Do App

A simple and efficient **To-Do App** built with **React** that allows users to:

- ➕ Add tasks  
- ✏️ Edit tasks  
- ❌ Delete tasks  
- ✅ Mark tasks as finished  
- 📂 View all tasks or only completed ones  

All data is stored in **localStorage**, so your tasks will remain even after refreshing or closing the browser.
